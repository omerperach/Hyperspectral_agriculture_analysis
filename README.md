# Hyperspectral_agriculture_analysis
This repo intention is to help you analyze hyperspectral data taken from agriculture field experiments throughout the season. 
For example, if you are working on a wheat field experiment and every week you measured the plots with an Analytical Spectral Device that recorded the reflectance of the plant in ~2000 wavelength, the code could help you to compute all the available normalize difference spectral indices from every week and to correlate them to a plant feature you measured.
